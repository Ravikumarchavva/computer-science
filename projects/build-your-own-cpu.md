# Build Your Own CPU

Design and implement a simple CPU from scratch to understand computer architecture fundamentals.

**Project Objectives**:
- Understand CPU components and their interactions
- Implement a basic instruction set architecture
- Build ALU, registers, and control logic
- Simulate CPU execution cycle

**CPU Components to Implement**:
- **Instruction Register**: Holds current instruction
- **Program Counter**: Points to next instruction
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**: Performs calculations
- **Register File**: Fast storage for operands
- **Control Unit**: Orchestrates operations
- **Memory Interface**: Handles data transfer

**Instruction Set**:
- LOAD: Load data from memory to register
- STORE: Store register data to memory
- ADD/SUB: Arithmetic operations
- JUMP: Control flow instructions
- HALT: Stop execution

**Tools and Technologies**:
- **Logisim**: Digital circuit design and simulation
- **Verilog/VHDL**: Hardware description languages
- **Assembly Language**: Low-level programming
- **CPU Simulators**: Software-based CPU emulation

**Learning Outcomes**:
- Deep understanding of fetch-decode-execute cycle
- Knowledge of digital circuit design
- Experience with hardware-software interface
- Problem-solving in constrained environments

**Extensions**:
- Add more instructions (multiply, divide)
- Implement pipelining
- Add interrupt handling
- Create assembler and compiler
