# Distributed Training Project

Implement distributed machine learning training across multiple machines or GPUs.

**Project Goals**:
- Set up distributed training environment
- Implement data and model parallelism
- Handle gradient synchronization
- Monitor and optimize training performance

**Key Concepts**:
- **Data Parallelism**: Split dataset across workers
- **Model Parallelism**: Split model across devices
- **Gradient Synchronization**: Aggregate updates from workers
- **Fault Tolerance**: Handle worker failures

**Technologies and Frameworks**:
- **PyTorch DistributedDataParallel**: Built-in distributed training
- **Horovod**: Efficient gradient aggregation
- **NCCL**: NVIDIA Collective Communications Library
- **Ray**: Distributed computing framework

**Implementation Steps**:
