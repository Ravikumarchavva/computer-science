# Compilers vs Interpreters

**Compilers** translate entire programs into machine code before execution:
- Advantages: Fast execution, standalone executables
- Disadvantages: Slower development cycle, platform-specific binaries
- Examples: C, C++, Rust

**Interpreters** translate and execute code line-by-line:
- Advantages: Faster development, platform-independent, interactive debugging
- Disadvantages: Slower execution, requires runtime environment
- Examples: Python, JavaScript, Ruby

**Just-in-Time (JIT) Compilers** combine both approaches, compiling code at runtime for better performance (e.g., Java JVM, JavaScript engines).
