# Instruction Set

An instruction set is the collection of machine language instructions that a CPU can execute. It defines the CPU's capabilities and interface.

Common instruction types:
- **Data movement**: Load, store, move data between registers and memory
- **Arithmetic**: Add, subtract, multiply, divide
- **Logical**: AND, OR, XOR, NOT operations
- **Control flow**: Jump, branch, call subroutines
- **I/O operations**: Read from/write to devices

**Assembly Language** provides human-readable mnemonics for these instructions, making programming closer to hardware possible.

**Machine Code** is the binary representation that the CPU directly executes.
