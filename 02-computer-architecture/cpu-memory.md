# CPU and Memory

The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the brain of the computer, executing instructions and performing calculations. Key components include:

- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**: Performs mathematical and logical operations
- **Control Unit**: Directs the operation of the processor
- **Registers**: Fast storage for immediate data access

**Memory Hierarchy**:
- Registers: Fastest, smallest storage inside CPU
- Cache (L1/L2/L3): Fast memory for frequently accessed data
- RAM: Main memory for running programs
- Storage: Persistent but slower storage (HDD/SSD)

Understanding this hierarchy is key to optimizing program performance and system design.
