# Transformers

The Transformer architecture revolutionized natural language processing and beyond.

**Core Innovation: Self-Attention**:
- **Attention Mechanism**: Focus on relevant parts of input
- **Self-Attention**: Attend to different positions in the same sequence
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Multiple attention mechanisms in parallel
- **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**: Efficient attention computation

**Transformer Components**:
- **Positional Encoding**: Add position information to token embeddings
- **Feed-Forward Networks**: Process each position independently
- **Layer Normalization**: Stabilize training
- **Residual Connections**: Enable deeper networks

**Encoder-Decoder Architecture**:
- **Encoder**: Process input sequence into representations
- **Decoder**: Generate output sequence using encoder representations
- **Masked Attention**: Prevent decoder from seeing future tokens

**Key Advantages**:
- Parallel processing (unlike RNNs)
- Long-range dependencies
- Transfer learning capabilities

**Applications**:
- Machine translation (original use case)
- Text generation and completion
- Code understanding and generation
- Multimodal tasks (vision-language models)
