# Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning enables computers to learn from data without explicit programming.

**Types of Machine Learning**:
- **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled examples
  - Classification: Predicting categories (spam detection, image recognition)
  - Regression: Predicting continuous values (price prediction, temperature forecasting)
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
  - Clustering: Grouping similar data points
  - Dimensionality Reduction: Simplifying data while preserving structure
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through trial and error with rewards

**Key Concepts**:
- Training, validation, and test datasets
- Overfitting (memorizing training data) vs underfitting (too simple model)
- Bias-variance tradeoff
- Cross-validation for model evaluation

**Essential Algorithms**:
- Linear/Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- K-Means Clustering
