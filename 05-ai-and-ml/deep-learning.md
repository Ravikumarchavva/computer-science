# Deep Learning

Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns.

**Artificial Neural Networks**:
- **Neurons**: Basic computational units with weights and activation functions
- **Layers**: Input, hidden, and output layers
- **Activation Functions**: ReLU, sigmoid, tanh for introducing nonlinearity
- **Feedforward Networks**: Information flows from input to output

**Training Deep Networks**:
- **Backpropagation**: Algorithm for computing gradients
- **Loss Functions**: Measures of prediction error (MSE, cross-entropy)
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Gradient descent variants (Adam, SGD)
- **Regularization**: Techniques to prevent overfitting (dropout, batch normalization)

**Deep Architectures**:
- Convolutional Neural Networks for vision tasks
- Recurrent Neural Networks for sequential data
- Autoencoders for unsupervised learning
- Generative Adversarial Networks for content generation

**Challenges and Solutions**:
- Vanishing gradients → Residual connections, better activation functions
- Computational requirements → GPU acceleration, distributed training
