# Reinforcement Learning

Learning through interaction with environments to maximize cumulative rewards.

**Core Components**:
- **Agent**: Decision-making entity
- **Environment**: External system the agent interacts with
- **Actions**: Choices available to the agent
- **Rewards**: Feedback signals from the environment
- **States**: Representations of the current situation

**Key Concepts**:
- **Policy**: Strategy for choosing actions given states
- **Value Function**: Expected future rewards for states or state-action pairs
- **Q-Learning**: Model-free algorithm for learning action values
- **Exploration vs Exploitation**: Balance between trying new actions and using known good actions

**Algorithms**:
- **Value-Based**: Learn value functions (Q-learning, SARSA)
- **Policy-Based**: Directly learn policies (REINFORCE)
- **Actor-Critic**: Combine value and policy learning
- **Deep RL**: Use neural networks for function approximation

**Applications**:
- Game playing (AlphaGo, Atari games)
- Robotics and control systems
- Recommendation systems
- Resource management and scheduling

**Challenges**:
- Sample inefficiency
- Reward design
- Exploration in large state spaces
- Safety and alignment
