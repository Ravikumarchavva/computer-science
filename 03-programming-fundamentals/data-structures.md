# Data Structures

Data structures organize and store data efficiently for various operations.

**Linear Structures**:
- **Arrays/Lists**: Ordered collections with indexed access
- **Stacks**: Last-in, first-out (LIFO) operations
- **Queues**: First-in, first-out (FIFO) operations
- **Linked Lists**: Elements connected by pointers

**Non-Linear Structures**:
- **Trees**: Hierarchical structures (binary trees, heaps)
- **Graphs**: Networks with nodes and edges
- **Hash Tables**: Key-value pairs with fast lookups

**Choosing Data Structures**: Depends on access patterns, insertion/deletion frequency, and memory constraints. The right choice can dramatically improve algorithm performance.
