# Modern Distributed Machine Learning

Techniques and frameworks for training ML models across multiple machines and GPUs.

**Distributed Training Paradigms**:

**Data Parallelism**:
- Split training data across workers
- Each worker has full model copy
- Gradients synchronized after each batch
- Most common approach for large datasets

**Model Parallelism**:
- Split model across workers
- Each worker handles portion of model
- Used for very large models (GPT, BERT)
- Complex communication patterns

**Pipeline Parallelism**:
- Process different layers on different devices
- Overlap computation and communication
- GPipe and 1F1B (One Forward One Backward) techniques

**Key Frameworks**:
- **Horovod**: Ring-based allreduce for efficient gradient aggregation
- **NCCL**: NVIDIA Collective Communications Library
- **Ray**: Unified framework for distributed computing
- **DeepSpeed**: Microsoft's optimization library for large models

**Communication Strategies**:
- **AllReduce**: Efficient gradient aggregation across workers
- **Parameter Servers**: Centralized model updates
- **Gradient Compression**: Reduce communication bandwidth
- **Asynchronous Updates**: Workers update independently

**Optimization Techniques**:
- **Mixed Precision Training**: Use float16 for faster computation
- **Gradient Accumulation**: Simulate larger batch sizes
- **ZeRO (Zero Redundancy Optimizer)**: Partition optimizer states
- **Elastic Training**: Handle worker failures and scaling

**Challenges and Solutions**:
- **Communication Bottlenecks**: Use faster interconnects, optimize algorithms
- **Synchronization Overhead**: Asynchronous methods, better scheduling
- **Fault Tolerance**: Checkpointing, elastic scaling
- **Load Imbalance**: Dynamic batching, adaptive scheduling

**Cloud-Native Solutions**:
- AWS SageMaker distributed training
- Google Cloud AI Platform
- Azure Machine Learning
- Kubernetes-based orchestration
