# Cloud Computing

On-demand delivery of computing resources and services over the internet.

**Service Models**:

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**:
- Virtual machines, storage, networks
- Examples: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure VMs
- Maximum control, but manage OS and applications

**Platform as a Service (PaaS)**:
- Development platforms and tools
- Examples: Heroku, Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Focus on application development, infrastructure managed

**Software as a Service (SaaS)**:
- Complete applications delivered over internet
- Examples: Gmail, Slack, Salesforce
- No infrastructure management required

**Deployment Models**:
- **Public Cloud**: Services offered by third-party providers
- **Private Cloud**: Dedicated infrastructure for single organization
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combination of public and private clouds
- **Multi-Cloud**: Using multiple public cloud providers

**Key Benefits**:
- **Scalability**: Scale resources up/down as needed
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-as-you-go pricing model
- **Global Reach**: Data centers worldwide
- **Managed Services**: Offload operational tasks

**Core Technologies**:
- **Virtualization**: Abstract hardware resources
- **Containers**: Lightweight application packaging (Docker, Kubernetes)
- **Serverless**: Run code without managing servers (AWS Lambda)
- **Microservices**: Decompose applications into small services

**Challenges**:
- Security and data privacy
- Vendor lock-in
- Network latency
- Cost management and optimization
