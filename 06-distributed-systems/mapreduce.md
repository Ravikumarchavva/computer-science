# MapReduce

Programming model for processing large datasets in parallel across clusters.

**Core Components**:
- **Map Function**: Processes input key-value pairs to generate intermediate pairs
- **Shuffle Phase**: Groups intermediate values by key across cluster nodes
- **Reduce Function**: Aggregates values for each key to produce final output

**Execution Flow**:
1. Input data split into chunks
2. Map tasks process chunks in parallel
3. Intermediate results shuffled and sorted
4. Reduce tasks aggregate results
5. Final output written to distributed storage

**Key Features**:
- **Automatic Parallelization**: Framework handles distribution across nodes
- **Fault Tolerance**: Failed tasks automatically restarted
- **Scalability**: Linear scaling with cluster size
- **Abstraction**: Programmers focus on map and reduce logic

**Programming Model**:
```python
def map(key, value):
    # Process input, emit (key, value) pairs
    
def reduce(key, values):
    # Aggregate values for key, emit results
```

**Limitations**:
- High latency for interactive queries
- Inefficient for iterative algorithms
- Complex for multi-stage pipelines
- Not suitable for real-time processing

**Modern Alternatives**:
- Apache Spark (improved performance)
- Apache Flink (streaming focus)
- Cloud-native solutions (AWS EMR, Google Dataflow)
