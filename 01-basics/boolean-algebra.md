# Boolean Algebra

Boolean algebra is a mathematical system for logical operations. It deals with variables that can have only two values: true (1) or false (0).

Key operations:
- AND (∧): Conjunction - true only if both operands are true
- OR (∨): Disjunction - true if at least one operand is true
- NOT (¬): Negation - inverts the operand

Boolean algebra forms the foundation of digital circuit design and is essential for understanding how computers process logical decisions.
