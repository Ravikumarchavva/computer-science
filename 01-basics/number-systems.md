# Number Systems

Computers use different number systems for various purposes:

- **Decimal (Base 10)**: The standard system humans use (0-9)
- **Binary (Base 2)**: Used internally by computers (0-1)
- **Octal (Base 8)**: Sometimes used for file permissions (0-7)
- **Hexadecimal (Base 16)**: Used for memory addresses and color codes (0-9, A-F)

Understanding conversion between these systems is crucial for low-level programming and computer architecture.
