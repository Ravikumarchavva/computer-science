# Why Binary?

Computers use the binary system because it aligns with the physical properties of electronic switches. A bit can be either 0 or 1, representing off or on states. This simplicity allows for reliable data storage and processing using transistors.

Binary provides a robust foundation for digital computing, enabling error-free representation of data through simple on/off states.
