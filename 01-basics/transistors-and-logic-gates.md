# Transistors and Logic Gates

Transistors are semiconductor devices that act as electronic switches, controlling the flow of electricity. They form the basic building blocks of all modern digital circuits.

Logic gates are digital circuits that perform basic logical operations:
- AND gate: Outputs true only if all inputs are true
- OR gate: Outputs true if at least one input is true
- NOT gate: Inverts the input signal

These gates, built from transistors, enable computers to perform complex computations through combinations of simple operations.
