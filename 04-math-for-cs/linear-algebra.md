# Linear Algebra

Linear algebra provides the mathematical foundation for many computer science applications.

**Core Concepts**:
- **Vectors**: Ordered arrays representing points, directions, or data
- **Matrices**: 2D arrays for transformations and linear systems
- **Matrix Operations**: Addition, multiplication, transposition, inversion
- **Linear Transformations**: Functions that preserve vector addition and scalar multiplication

**Advanced Topics**:
- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: Special values characterizing linear transformations
- **Vector Spaces**: Abstract algebraic structures
- **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**: Matrix factorization technique

**Applications**:
- Computer graphics (rotations, scaling)
- Machine learning (principal component analysis)
- Data compression and signal processing
