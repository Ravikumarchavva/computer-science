# Probability

Probability theory provides tools for reasoning about uncertainty and random events.

**Fundamental Concepts**:
- **Sample Space**: Set of all possible outcomes
- **Events**: Subsets of the sample space
- **Probability Axioms**: Rules governing probability calculations
- **Conditional Probability**: Probability of A given B has occurred
- **Bayes' Theorem**: Updating beliefs based on new evidence

**Random Variables and Distributions**:
- **Discrete Random Variables**: Countable outcomes (Binomial, Poisson)
- **Continuous Random Variables**: Uncountable outcomes (Normal, Exponential)
- **Expected Value**: Long-run average of a random variable
- **Variance**: Measure of spread around the mean

**Applications in CS**:
- Algorithm analysis (randomized algorithms)
- Machine learning (uncertainty quantification)
- System reliability and fault tolerance
